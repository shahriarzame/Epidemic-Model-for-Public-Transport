# Epidemic-Model-for-Public-Transport
This model was developed using Object Oriented JAVA principles for the final assignment of the OOP for Transport Engineers course at the TUM. A world was created with a set of 500 passengers, 4 buses and 4 bus stations. The spread of epidemic of a year (and more) was modelled for various scenarios, e.g. different quarantine preferences, impact of vaccine, impact of mandatory mask usage, and impact of 50% population teleworking (not taking part in travels). The codes and csv outputs are added here. We also created a report for the project which depicts and describes all the outcomes.
